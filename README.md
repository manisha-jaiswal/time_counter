TIME COUNTER

    Have you ever needed a countdown timer on a project? For something like that, it might be natural 
    to reach for a plugin, but it’s actually a lot more straightforward to make one than you might think 
    and only requires the trifecta of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Let’s make one together!
 
 Here are a few things the timer does that we’ll be covering in this post:

    1.Displays the initial time remaining
    2.Converts the time value to a MM:SS format
    3.Calculates the difference between the initial time remaining and how much time has passed
    4.Changes color as the time remaining nears zero
    5.Displays the progress of time remaining as an animated ring
 
Explanation

    Here i used two html file where first file stores the main page where you will see a button click .
    After clicking that button you will move on the next page where you will see a timer which will 
    start automatically. 
 
    Here i also used backgraound color ,font color ,font size ,font type etc.
 
    It is based on HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
